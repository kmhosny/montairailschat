### Monta AI Rails Chat

The Monta AI task is developed using Ruby on Rails instead of the most go to options.

### Why Rails

Python is great, I know it's great but for computation and writing a more granular mathematical/data manipulation code.
Most frameworks I've seen for SaaS apps, specially following MVC, in python aren't very optimised for such apps and don't provide a standard way to write such code. Ruby on Rails on the other hand is mature in this domain and can provide a much smoother development for such apps.

### does a GPT app follow the same SaaS pattern?
Great question and from what I see the answer is yes. the GPT engine is just another processing block for data so no need to treat GPT based apps any different.
